## Source Code Reference
```java
if (username.equals("admin") && password.equals("secret123")) {
        return new Response("Authenticated", 200);
    }

    return new Response("Unauthorized", 401);
}

# Authentication Code Fragment Documentation

## Overview

This code fragment implements a simple authentication check for user credentials. It validates whether the provided username and password match hardcoded values and returns an appropriate HTTP response based on the authentication result. This appears to be part of a larger authentication method or endpoint handler.

## Parameters

Based on the code logic, this fragment expects the following variables to be in scope:

- **username** (String): The username credential to validate
- **password** (String): The password credential to validate

## Return Values

The code returns Response objects with the following structure:

### Success Response (200)
When authentication succeeds (username is "admin" AND password is "secret123"):
```java
new Response("Authenticated", 200)
```
- Message: "Authenticated"
- Status Code: 200 (OK)

### Failure Response (401)
When authentication fails (any other username/password combination):
```java
new Response("Unauthorized", 401)
```
- Message: "Unauthorized"
- Status Code: 401 (Unauthorized)

## Validation Logic

The authentication process follows this logic:

1. **Credential Comparison**: Uses the `.equals()` method to perform exact string matching for both username and password fields against hardcoded values.

2. **Conjunction Check**: Both conditions must be true simultaneously using the AND operator (&&):
   - Username must exactly match "admin"
   - Password must exactly match "secret123"

3. **Success Path**: If both conditions are satisfied, immediately returns a success Response object with status 200.

4. **Default Failure Path**: If the condition check fails (either username doesn't match, password doesn't match, or both don't match), execution continues to the return statement that sends an unauthorized Response with status 401.

## Notes

- **Security Warning**: This implementation is NOT suitable for production use. It contains several critical security issues:
  - Hardcoded credentials in source code
  - Plaintext password comparison
  - No password hashing or encryption
  - Single hardcoded user account
  - Credentials may be exposed in version control systems

- **Case Sensitivity**: The `.equals()` method performs case-sensitive comparisons, so "Admin" or "ADMIN" would not match "admin".

- **Null Safety**: This code does not include null checks. If either username or password is null, calling `.equals()` on a null reference will throw a NullPointerException. Consider using null-safe comparison methods or adding explicit null checks.

- **String Comparison**: Using `.equals()` for password comparison is vulnerable to timing attacks. Production code should use constant-time comparison methods to prevent attackers from determining password length or partial matches through timing analysis.

- **Hardcoded Credentials**: The credentials are:
  - Username: "admin"
  - Password: "secret123"

- **HTTP Status Codes**: Follows standard HTTP conventions with 200 for successful authentication and 401 for unauthorized access attempts.

- **Production Recommendations**: For production systems, implement:
  - Database-backed user management
  - Password hashing (bcrypt, argon2, PBKDF2)
  - Salt generation for each password
  - Account lockout mechanisms
  - Multi-factor authentication
  - Secure credential storage (environment variables, secret management systems)
  - Logging and monitoring of authentication attempts
